## Nigel Marshal - CV

Created a lil repo to have a bit of a prettified CV using LaTeX. Switched to editing it on VSCode instead of Overleaf...because.

## Get the ball rollin'

`pdflatex cv.tex` -> Generates the pdf

or alternatively use a combination of [VSCode's LaTeX Workshop plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) and [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) to generate the pdf directly through VSCode
